### To Do List:

(update Github Projects with this)

Testing: Insert test data (Brainstorming/Test Project)

GUI:

Write task duplication method

Initialize/check for DB in startClass

Get Start Panel Working: Add Panel (new root task), add button to print all tasks to a file.

Get AddEditPanel Working: Create logic to make sure the panel has different constructors for adding and editing tasks. Key difference is that Add will pass a parent (even if that id is null), while Edit will pass original values of the task. Add/Edit panel will not support the view of children tasks. Create a dialog for submit, delete, and delete children.

Extra:

Create CountUpTaskManager .css file for MarkDown formatting of tasks
