### To Do List:

(update Github Projects with this)

Testing: Insert test data (Brainstorming/Test Project)

GUI:

Write task duplication method

Initialize/check for DB in startClass

Bug: When deleting a newly created task, it deleted all tasks (probably did not create where clause)

Bug: When creating a task, the task panel does not show the created date. This is because the database creates the timestamp. Once the task is viewed again, it will populate.

Bug: Update is catching values that are not changing.

Bug: Update is not changing title.

Bug: Completed/Started "Clear buttons" are not working

Extra:

Create CountUpTaskManager .css file for MarkDown formatting of tasks
