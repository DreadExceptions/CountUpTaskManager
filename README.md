# CountUpTaskManager
A simple task-tracking app using Java and SqlLite.

## Organization of Repo
The git repository is organized with brainstorming and planning files being in the Brainstorm folder. SQL files are in the Database folder, while the Java files are in the CountUpTasks folder. The CountUpTasks folder is a Maven project, and it contains two main folders - one for backend and one for the GUI. 

## Functional Requirements
* Used to keep track of tasks: completed, in progress, or not started.
* Ability to add, edit, or delete tasks.
* Ability to sort tasks in view.

## Design
* Use SQLite as a database to store information locally.
* Use Java to create GUI and interface with SQLite.
* Create separate screens for each function, with simple front-end designs.
